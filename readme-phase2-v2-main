; This program will receive a string terminated by character 0DH
; using the serial port and will re-sent it using the serial port
; as well. Note that when using the UART unit connected to EdSim51
; when sending strings, the character \r (hex code 0DH) is automatically
; inserted at the end of the string when transmitted.


; UART configured as 8-bit (variable baud rate, defined by T1)
; UART must be set to NO parity
; This program used 4800
; This program uses interrupts instead of polling
; Note the crystal used must be changed to 11.0592 MHz
